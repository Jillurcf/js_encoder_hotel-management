# Brief Overview of Architecture:
The hotel booking application is a frontend solution developed using React with TypeScript, UseState for state management, and CSS Modules for styling. It offers users an intuitive interface to browse hotels, view rooms, and book accommodations. The application interacts with a static JSON file as its data source, simulating real-world data fetching scenarios. Users can authenticate through a simulated login functionality and seamlessly navigate through the various views to find and book their desired rooms. With a focus on modern React practices and comprehensive type safety using TypeScript, the application ensures a smooth and reliable user experience.
